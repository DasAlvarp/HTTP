For this project, I started by making a parsing system for the HTTP request. As it turns up, I basically only needed to read the GET line, which made that whole job a lot easier. When the GET line is recieved, it's split by spaces, those parts are checked, and so on. Since all of those lines are recieved at the same time, a new thread starts at this point. This line is all you need to implement the Server and content info stuff too, so that's all done here.
After the type to send has been figured out, the file to be sent is found and sent as a byte array. There was a funny issue when I initially used strings, and converted the byte array into a string, and sent that, which absolutely broke my terminal. However, these two byte arrays (header and content) are then sent back to the sender, and the client port is closed.
